### **Research Focus**

My work is centered at the intersection of generative artificial intelligence and computational geometry. I am currently developing novel architectures for **Stochastic Latent Diffusion Models** with the goal of synthesizing high-fidelity, complex 3D meshes and environments directly from semantic and textual inputs.

My primary research, **"Project Natch,"** aims to create a foundational model for procedural 3D asset generation, which requires a significant multi-GPU compute environment for training and inference.
