# Project-Natch
The creation of detailed 3D assets for simulation, media, and virtual environments remains a significant bottleneck, demanding extensive manual labor and specialized expertise. This research proposes "Project Chimera," a novel framework that leverages stochastic latent diffusion models to generate complex, high-fidelity 3D meshes and textures directly from natural language prompts. Our methodology introduces a cross-modal attention mechanism designed to better capture geometric nuance and semantic relationships from textual descriptions. The primary objective is to train a foundational model on a large-scale, aggregated dataset (including ShapeNet and LAION-5B) to serve as a universal asset generator. **Success in this research is critically dependent on access to a high-performance, multi-GPU compute environment with substantial VRAM (ideally 48GB+)** to accommodate the memory requirements of our model architecture and the scale of the training data.
